## Info
#### **You must disable this whenever you play any other Frostbite game or if you encounter issues with other games.**
It is recommended to launch the game with Frosty after enabling mods.
It works directly from Origin/EA Desktop but it's better to launch Battlefront from Frosty Mod Manager/Editor to guarantee everything is working fine and to refresh your mod list.
**You must run this program again every time you want to play another Frostbite game**, so you can either disable mods or select the other game.

## FAQ

> **Q:** What issues does FrostyFix solve?
> 
> **A:** If you own a Frosty supported game on Steam, Epic Games Store, or use EA Desktop, **Frosty may launch the game without any mods applied**. This has something to do with how command line arguments are handled in platforms other than Origin. FrostyFix sets an environment variable instead of using commandline arguments which makes the platform a game on irrelevent.

> **Q:** Frosty is giving me an error, how do I use FrostyFix to solve this?
> 
> **A:** If Frosty is giving you an error, then it is an issue with your mod setup or how your Frosty is configured. FrostyFix was not created to solve those issue.

> **Q:** When I try to launch game other than the one I chose in FrostyFix, I get an error
> 
> **A:** You **MUST** disable mods before playing any other Frostbite game 

> **Q:** Why are some games greyed out?
> 
> **A:** If FrostyFix cannot locate a game, it greys out the option making it unselectable to prevent an empty variable to be set.

These games are confirmed to be unsupported because they DO NOT USE a environment variable unlike most other Frostbite Games. They will not be able to be fixed through FrostyFix
